# tetris_the_terminal
A terminal-based unfaithful clone of the original Tetris: The Grandmaster

Controls: 'W' and 'D' to move the blocks left and right. 
'S' moves the block towards the bottom more quickly. 
'Q' and 'E' rotate the block.

For meta commands, type 'python main.py --help'

Make your terminal big enough to see the whole gamespace.
